## Overview
The goal here is simple yet complex, use various models and prediction methods to determine what sort of model is best at predicting credit risk
## Results
- Random Oversampling - 65%
- SMOTE Oversampling - 66%
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier - 79%

## Summary
Seemingly the Random Forest Classifier is extremely good at predicting credit risk as it did so with over 10% accuracy more than the other models
